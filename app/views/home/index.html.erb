  <p>
    Welcome to <strong><em>inStock</em></strong>, a more powerful way to manage your Shopify inventory. Here are some things you can do with inStock:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <%= link_to("Receivings", :controller => 'receivings') %> to track inventory you receive from your vendors. (Update stock counts quickly for all products received.)</li>
      <li>Use <%= link_to("Stock Adjustments", :controller => 'stock_adjustments')%> when inventory counts change for reasons other than receiving or sales.</li>
      <li>Periodicaly use <%= link_to("Stock Audits", :controller => 'stock_audits') %> to make sure the inventory count in Shopify matches up with how many items you actually have on hand. (Better safe than sorry.)
    </ul>
    More to come later...
